    <div id="section 2"><h1>blockchain technology</h1><h1><p>Blockchain technology is an advanced database mechanism that allows
         transparent information sharing within a business network. A blockchain database stores data in blocks that are linked
          together in a chain. The data is chronologically consistent because you cannot delete or modify the chain without
           consensus from the network. As a result, you can use blockchain technology to create an unalterable or immutable
            ledger for tracking orders, payments, accounts, and other transactions. The system has built-in mechanisms
             that prevent unauthorized transaction entries and create consistency in the shared view of these transactions.
